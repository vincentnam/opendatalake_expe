6 questions have been asked : 
- Q1 : Are you: not at all comfortable with dataset search platforms (0 platforms used), somewhat comfortable with data management platforms (platforms used occasionally or minimally) or comfortable with dataset search platforms (multiple platforms used multiple times)?
- Q2 : How many dataset search platforms do you know of ?
- Q3 : Did you know the 3 platforms tested before?
- Q4 : Without knowing about these platforms, do you think you would have been able to find the datasets you found in one way or another?
- Q5 : From 1 (not at all necessary) to 5 (absolutely necessary), how necessary do you think unified data access is?
- Q6 : Which of the three platforms tested do you prefer (AERIS, ODATIS or PDB)?
